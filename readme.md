## Syncr v0.1 README ##

### A simple to-do app ###

##### View current build demo here: <a href="http://ryanchapel.com/syncr" target="_blank">http://ryanchapel.com/syncr</a> ####

#### Right now you can currently: ####
* Create lists
* Change the list you're viewing
* Ability to rename, clear, and delete lists.
* Add, edit, and delete items.


#### To-do's ####
* More / better touch support and new touch actions coming soon.
* Ability to save data and sync across all users. This is the hardest part of the whole project, but the entire reason I'm making this app. I'm gonna have to learn how to do it...no clue at the moment though. :)
* More to come. Have any suggestions? Let me hear them! Email me at <a href="mailto:chaprtc@gmail.com?subject=Syncr%20Suggestions">chaprtc@gmail.com</a>
